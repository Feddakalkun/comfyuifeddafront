Here are the best general-purpose Ollama models that are NSFW-friendly (uncensored/unfiltered variants) and confirmed active as of early 2026 (recent updates/downloads, per library listings and community benchmarks).

Best NSFW-friendly general models

​

cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.9.3-mistral-nemo-12b – Dolphin uncensored series on Mistral Nemo, strong for anything-goes tasks (active 2026).
