## [2026-04-01] LTX T2V — Silent failure fixed

**Problem:** LTX Text-to-Video generated nothing, showed no error.

**Root cause:** `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` node package was outdated and didn't match the 22B model architecture.

**Fix:** `update.bat` now force-updates `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` (and RES4LYF, KJNodes) every run — not just once a week.

**Action needed:** Run `update.bat` → restart via `run.bat` → LTX T2V should work.
